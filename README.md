# screenshot_from_site

The main file is the index.js which uses gdrive_api.js to upload the screenshots to my google drive. 

The credentials (client key, etc) used for the google drive are not entered in the code for security reasons!  
Also, running the gdrive_api.js you need to change parameters (e.g., parent folder on file upload) according to your references. 

To run the code use:
  node index.js
